Task: 
The	number	e	is	an	important	mathematical	constant	that	is	the	base	of	the	natural	logarithm.	e	
also	arises	in	the	study	of	compound	interest,	and	in	many	other	applications.		
Background	of	e:	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)	
		
The	value	of	e	is	approximately	equal	to	2.71828.	We	can	get	an	approximate	value	of	e,	by	
calculating	only	a	partial	sum	of	the	infinite	sum	above	(the	more	addends	we	add,	the	better	
approximation	we	get).	
	
Implement	the	function:	
double eApprox(int n)
This	function	is	given	a	positive	integer	n,	and	returns	an	approximation	of	e,	calculated	by	the	
sum	of	the	first	(n+1)	addends	of	the	infinite	sum	above.	
	
To	test	your	function	use	the	following	main:	
int main() {
cout.precision(30);
for (int n = 1; n <= 15; n++) {
cout<<"n = "<<n<<'\t'<<eApprox(n)<<endl;
}
return 0;
}
	
Notes:	
1. Pay	attention	to	the	running	time	of	eApprox.	An	efficient	implementation	would	run	in	
Î˜ n .	
2. Since	the	values	of	the	factorials	will	grow	to	be	very	large,	use	a	variable	of	type	double	
to	store	them.
